# things to fix

- Tab names are always extend to their full path
- C-n and C-b should close the terminals that are open
- Change the jump mechanic of leap
- Change the cursor, it is hard to see what's happening with {}
- When I stay on something it should pop up the documentation of it
- Disable DAP, it gives me headache
